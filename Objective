# Amazon Product Scraper - Project Objective & Progress

**Objective:** Create a simple script to scrape Amazon product listings from the first page of search results for a given keyword.

## üìã Task Progress Tracking

### ‚úÖ Backend/API (Bun) - **COMPLETED**

- [x] Set up a Bun project with the necessary dependencies (express, axios and JSDOM)
- [x] Write a script using axios to fetch the contents of the Amazon search results page for a given keyword
- [x] Use JSDOM to parse the HTML content and extract the following details for each product listing on the first page:
  - [x] Product Title
  - [x] Rating (stars out of five)
  - [x] Number of reviews
  - [x] Product image URL
- [x] Create an endpoint `/api/scrape` where a GET request with a query parameter `?keyword=yourKeyword` initiates the scraping process
- [x] Return the extracted data in JSON format
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and validation
- [x] Include CORS support for frontend integration
- [x] Add health check endpoint (`/api/health`)

### ‚úÖ Frontend (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript with Vite) - **COMPLETED**

- [x] Develop a simple webpage with:
  - [x] An input field to enter the search keyword
  - [x] A button to initiate the scraping process
- [x] Style the webpage to be user-friendly and presentable
  - [x] Responsive design for mobile and desktop
  - [x] Modern gradient background with Amazon-inspired colors
  - [x] Smooth animations and hover effects
- [x] Implement JavaScript to make an AJAX call to the backend endpoint when the button is clicked
- [x] Display the results formatted cleanly on the page
  - [x] Product cards with title, rating, reviews, and image
  - [x] Loading states and error handling
  - [x] Rating stars visualization
  - [x] Image fallback for broken URLs

- [x] Document all technologies used

### ‚úÖ Quality Considerations - **COMPLETED**

- [x] Ensure you handle errors gracefully both on the backend and frontend
- [x] Provide clear instructions on how to run the application
- [x] The cleaner and more functional the code is, the better
- [x] Add input validation and sanitization
- [x] Implement proper HTTP status codes
- [x] Add request timeout handling

## üöÄ Additional Features Implemented
