## ❌ Outstanding Issues

### Backend Testing - Critical Issues

#### 1. **Jest/Bun Compatibility** 
```bash
TypeError: jest.mock is not a function
```
- **Cause**: Bun runtime doesn't natively support Jest
- **Impact**: All backend tests fail to execute
- **Priority**: 🔴 HIGH

#### 2. **Test Framework Configuration**
- Existing `jest.config.js` needs proper Bun compatibility
- Alternative: Migrate to Bun's native test runner
- **Priority**: 🔴 HIGH  

#### 3. **Duplicate Test Files**
- `server.test.js` and `tests/api.test.js` test same functionality
- Need consolidation and cleanup
- **Priority**: 🟡 MEDIUM

### Frontend Testing - Minor Issues

#### 1. **Vitest Configuration** ✅ (Mostly Working)
- Basic setup complete with JSDOM
- Functions now properly exported from main.js
- **Status**: Ready for test implementation
- **Priority**: 🟢 LOW

## 📝 Test Commands (Current Status)

### Backend (Need Fixing)
```bash
cd backend
bun test                    # Currently fails due to Jest/Bun issues
bun test --coverage        # Not working until framework fixed
bun test --watch           # Not working until framework fixed
```

### Frontend (Ready)
```bash
cd frontend  
bun test                    # Should work once tests written
bun run coverage           # Vitest coverage ready
bun test --watch           # Watch mode available
```

## 📞 Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** August 7, 2025  
**Responsible:** Claude Code Assistant  
**Next Review:** After test framework fixes

**Executive Summary:**
> The application core functionality is working well with recent fixes to i18n, CSS loading, and URL redirection. The main blocker for testing is the Jest/Bun compatibility issue in the backend. Frontend testing infrastructure is ready. Once the backend testing framework is resolved, comprehensive test implementation can proceed rapidly.

**Priority Actions:**
1. 🔴 **Immediate**: Fix backend test framework (Jest/Bun compatibility)
2. 🟡 **Short-term**: Write comprehensive test suites for both frontend and backend
3. 🟢 **Long-term**: Implement CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
